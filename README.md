This is a NodeJS CLI helps you quickly generate your React components either as a JavaScript or TypeScript file. This is really helpful if you work a lot with component libraries and want to save time from manually creating these files by hand.

## Usage

Recommended

```bash
npx component-scaffolder
```

Alternatives

```bash
npm install --dev component-scaffolder

# or

yarn add --dev component-scaffolder
```

For component scaffolder to work properly, it assumes that you have a `src` folder and `components` folder in your current working directory.

Follow the prompt that appears and select the type of files you want your components to be in (either JavaScript/TypeScript), and input the name of your component

## What's included?
